# üß∏ Motivation
 - I was using uptimerobot as oversight monitoring, but needed more features, especially the DNS Zone monitoring.
 - I needed to automatically process e-mails from secondary monitoring tools (like Synology NAS HyperBackup, Zabbix, ...).
 - Improve my C# Skills and learn Blazor ([PNMT.WebApp](https://github.com/muqiuq/PNMT.WebApp)).
